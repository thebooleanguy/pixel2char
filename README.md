# ðŸŽ¥ pixel2char

**pixel2char** is a fun little Python script that turns your webcam feed into real-time ASCII art in the terminal.

It captures frames from your webcam, downsizes them to 40x40, converts them to grayscale, and then maps the brightness levels to ASCII characters for a cool, live pixel-art effect.

This was my first time playing around with OpenCV in Python â€” mostly recreational and definitely not practical â€” but it was a fun mini weekend project!

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Python 3
- `opencv-python`

Install OpenCV with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
````

## ðŸš€ Run it

```bash
python pixel2char.py
```

Use `Ctrl + C` to exit the loop.

## ðŸ¤” Notes

* The ASCII art isnâ€™t super clear (yet) â€” it's more on the artistic/abstract side.
* It works best in well-lit conditions with a decent webcam feed.
* Tested on Linux (uses `clear` to wipe terminal); might need changes for Windows (`cls`).

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

* Tune character mapping for better clarity
* Add color?
* Output to a text file or stream

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

*(Imagine a bunch of ASCII characters dancing in your terminal based on your camera feed. Yep, thatâ€™s it.)*

ðŸ§  Just a fun experiment in Python + OpenCV!
